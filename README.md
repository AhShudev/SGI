# Sistemas Gráficos Interativos - FEUP


## Projects

### [TP1 - ThreeJS Basics](tp1)

- Strong Points:
  - Utilizes Three.js to create a 3D scene with interactive elements.
  - Demonstrates the use of geometry, lighting, materials, and textures.
  - Features a GUI for controlling scene properties in real time.
- Scene:
  - The scene reflects a cozy room with textured walls, a table setup, and decorative items.
  - There’s a well-detailed table with various elements on top, including a cake, plates, and a candle with a flame. Spotlights enhance the ambiance, casting shadows on a red carpet below.
  - The scene includes additional decorations on the walls, adding a sense of depth and realism.

### [TP2 - 3D Graphics](tp2)
- The created scene is based on a supermarket. Each node represents an object or light, allowing for recursive and reusable scene construction in YASF file. The project includes textured primitives, applied transformations (translation, rotation, scaling), and lighting setups.
- Strong Points:
  - Dynamic Scene Construction: The application processes hierarchical JSON data to construct scenes, enabling flexibility and scalability.
  - Support for Multiple Primitive Types: Includes rendering of boxes, spheres, triangles, rectangles, cylinders, and NURBS surfaces.

### [TP3 - ...](tp3)
- Hot Air Balloon Racing game featuring controllable hot air balloons using dynamic wind layers.
- The game features a vibrant 3D racing track set in a whimsical landscape. Players can control hot air balloons through a series of wind layers while navigating around obstacles and collecting power-ups.
